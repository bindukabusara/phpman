        Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United (often stylised as Man Utd), or simply United, is a
        professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. The club competes in the Premier League,
        the top division in the English football league system. Nicknamed the Red Devils, it was founded as Newton Heath LYR
        Football Club in 1878, but changed its name to Manchester United in 1902. The club moved from Newton Heath to its
        current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.
        Manchester United have won a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups, and a record 21 FA Community
        Shields. They have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup
        Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each.[5][6] In 1968, under
        the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they
        became the first English club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson is the club's longest-serving and most successful
        manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, five FA Cups, and two Champions League titles between 1986 and
        2013.[7][8] In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to
        achieve the European treble of the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League.[9] In winning the UEFA Europa
        League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club
        competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).
